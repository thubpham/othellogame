Othello - A Simple Game of Strategy

Othello is a classic two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid. The goal is to have the most pieces of your color on the board by the end of the game. Players take turns placing their pieces, flipping their opponent’s pieces in the process.

How to Play: 
1. The game starts with four pieces in the center (two black, two white).
2. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board.
3. A move must outflank at least one opponent’s piece (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to flip them.
4. If a player has no valid moves, they pass their turn.
5. The game ends when neither player can make a move. The player with the most pieces on the board wins!
